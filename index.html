			Hello, my name is <strong>Jeanne</strong>. 
			I am currently in third-year at IESEG School of Management where I am developing my skills and knowledge in business and management. 

			I am a very <strong>dynamic, sociable and organised</strong>  person who loves interacting with people. I always strive to do my best to achieve my goals and I love to take on new challenges.

			I love <strong>travelling, dancing,</strong>  and expressing my creativity by <strong>playing piano and taking pictures.</strong>

		<h2>Travels</h2>
		<p class="text-justify">
			I really like <strong>travelling</strong>, in order to discover new places, cultures and landscapes. Last summer, I had the chance to do my internship in Singapore and to travel in different countries in Asia. I went to Malaisia, Bali, Thailand, Myanmar and Philippines. It was a very enriching experience. All the trips that I went on have given me the opportunity to discover different cultures and have developed my open-mindedness.
